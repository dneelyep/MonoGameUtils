MonoGameUtils
=============

A collection of utility classes to use when making games in MonoGame

This library is currently in a pre-alpha state. I'm not even sure what I want it to do yet. It's currently serving as a place to dump my reusable MonoGame components when making games. Maybe one day it will turn into a useful library in its own right.
